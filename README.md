# quatTwist
Rigging node for Autodesk Maya to create a proper twist for a characterâ€™s arm or leg.
QuatTwist simply connects to the transform you want to handle the twist and gathers all the relevant quaternion-based data for the calculation.
It also provides additional controls as well as segmentation attributes which greatly reduces the need for additional nodes and twist-related networks.
